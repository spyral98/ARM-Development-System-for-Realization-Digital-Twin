# ARM-Development-System-for-Realization-of-a-Stepper-Motor-Digital-Twin
This repository consists of the work conducted for the thesis "ARM Development System for Relization of a Stepper Motor Digital Twin". It contains all the files necessary for the development of a fully functional system built around an STM32 Cortex-M4 microcontroller, as well as the code for a demo application for it. It also contains the code for a data representation application using Matlab.
