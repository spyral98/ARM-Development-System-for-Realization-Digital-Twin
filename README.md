# ARM-Development-System-to-Support-Digital-Twin-of-Stepper-Motor 
This repository consists of the work conducted for the thesis "ARM Development System to Support Digital Twin of Stepper Motor". It contains all the files necessary for the development of a fully functional system built around an STM32 Cortex-M4 microcontroller, as well as the code for a demo application for it. It also contains the code for a data representation application using Matlab.
